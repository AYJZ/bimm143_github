In this mini-project, we will explore FiveThirtyEight’s Halloween Candy dataset. 

## 1. Importing candy data

```{r}
candy_file <- "candy-data.csv"

candy = read.csv(candy_file, row.names=1)
head(candy)
```

> Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset?

```{r}
nrow(candy)
```

> Q2. How many fruity candy types are in the dataset?

```{r}
sum(candy$fruity)
```


## 2. What is your favorate candy?

We can find the winpercent value for Twix by using its name to access the corresponding row of the dataset.

```{r}
candy["Twix", ]$winpercent
```

> Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it’s winpercent value?

My favorite candy is M&M's and its winpercent is:

```{r}
candy["M&M's", ]$winpercent
```

> Q4. What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?

```{r}
candy["Kit Kat", ]$winpercent
```

> Q5. What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?

```{r}
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars", ]$winpercent
```

**Side Note**

```{r}
library("skimr")
skim(candy)
```


> Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

The `winpercent` column is on a different scale than the others.


> Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy$chocolate column?

0 means that the candy does not contain chocolate, and 1 is the candy does contains chocolate.


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

A good place to start any exploratory analysis is with a histogram...

> Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

```{r}
ggplot(candy) + aes(winpercent) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5)
```

> Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

No. The graph looks slightly right skewed.

> Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

Below.

```{r}
mean(candy$winpercent)
median(candy$winpercent)
```

> Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

```{r}
chocolate <- candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$chocolate)]
fruit <- candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$fruity)]

mean(chocolate) > mean(fruit)
```

Chocolate candy is higher ranked than fruit candy.


> Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

```{r}
t.test(chocolate, fruit)
```

Yes it is statistically significant because the p value is below threshold. 


## 3. Overall Candy Rankings

> Q13. What are the five least liked candy types in this set?

```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
candy %>%
  arrange(winpercent) %>%
  head(5)
```

> Q14. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?

```{r}
candy %>%
  arrange(desc(winpercent)) %>%
  head(5)
```

> Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.

```{r}
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, rownames(candy)) +
  geom_col()
```

*Note: `geom_bar()` counts the number of occurrences by default (needs categorical x), but `geom_col()` uses the actual values of winpercent.

> Q16. This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars sorted by winpercent?

```{r}
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col()
```

Let’s setup a color vector (that signifies candy type) that we can then use for some future plots.

```{r}
my_cols=rep("black", nrow(candy))
my_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] = "chocolate"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] = "brown"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] = "pink"
```

Now lets try our barplot with these colors.

```{r}
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill=my_cols) 
```

> Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

Nik L Nip

> Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

Reese Peanut Butter Cup


## 4. Taking a look at pricepercent

```{r}
library(ggrepel)

# How about a plot of price vs win
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) + 
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols, size=3.3, max.overlaps = 5)
```

> Q19. Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms of winpercent for the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your buck?

```{r}
rownames(candy)[which.max(candy$winpercent / candy$pricepercent)]
```


> Q20. What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and of these which is the least popular?

```{r}
ord <- order(candy$pricepercent, decreasing = TRUE)
head( candy[ord,c(11,12)], n=5 )
```

Nik L Nip is the least popular.


## 5. Exploring the correlation structure

Now that we’ve explored the dataset a little, we’ll see how the variables interact with one another. We’ll use correlation and view the results with the corrplot package to plot a correlation matrix.

```{r}
library(corrplot)
```

```{r}
cij <- cor(candy)
corrplot(cij)
```

> Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?

Chocolate and fruity are the most anti-correlated.

> Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?

Chocolate and bar. 


## 6. Principal Component Analysis

Let’s apply PCA using the `prcomp()` function to our candy dataset remembering to set the `scale=TRUE` argument.

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale=TRUE)
summary(pca)
```

```{r}
plot(pca$x[,1:2])
```

```{r}
plot(pca$x[,1:2], col=my_cols, pch=16)
```

We can make a much nicer plot with the ggplot2 package.

```{r}
# Make a new data-frame with our PCA results and candy data
my_data <- cbind(candy, pca$x[,1:3])
```

```{r}
p <- ggplot(my_data) + 
        aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, 
            size=winpercent/100,  
            text=rownames(my_data),
            label=rownames(my_data)) +
        geom_point(col=my_cols)

p
```

Again we can use the ggrepel package and the function ggrepel::geom_text_repel() to label up the plot with non overlapping candy names like. We will also add a title and subtitle like so:

```{r}
library(ggrepel)

p + geom_text_repel(size=3.3, col=my_cols, max.overlaps = 7)  + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title="Halloween Candy PCA Space",
       subtitle="Colored by type: chocolate bar (dark brown), chocolate other (light brown), fruity (red), other (black)",
       caption="Data from 538")
```

```{r}
library(plotly)
```

```{r}
# ggplotly(p)
```

Our loadings: 

```{r}
par(mar=c(8,4,2,2))
barplot(pca$rotation[,1], las=2, ylab="PC1 Contribution")
```

> Q24. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction? Do these make sense to you?

Values like fruity, hard, and pluribus are strongly picked up. It make sense becasue usualy these are the cheaper options (compare to ie chocolate and bar).
