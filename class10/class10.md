In this mini-project, we will explore FiveThirtyEight’s Halloween Candy
dataset.

## 1. Importing candy data

``` r
candy_file <- "candy-data.csv"

candy = read.csv(candy_file, row.names=1)
head(candy)
```

> Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset?

``` r
nrow(candy)
```

    [1] 85

> Q2. How many fruity candy types are in the dataset?

``` r

## 2. What is your favorate candy?

We can find the winpercent value for Twix by using its name to access
the corresponding row of the dataset.

``` r
candy["Twix", ]$winpercent
```

    [1] 81.64291

> Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it’s
> winpercent value?

My favorite candy is M&M’s and its winpercent is:

``` r
candy["M&M's", ]$winpercent
```

    [1] 66.57458

> Q4. What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?

``` r
candy["Kit Kat", ]$winpercent
```

    [1] 76.7686

> Q5. What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?

``` r
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars", ]$winpercent
```

    [1] 49.6535

**Side Note**

``` r
library("skimr")
skim(candy)

> Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale
> to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

The `winpercent` column is on a different scale than the others.

> Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the
> candy\$chocolate column?

0 means that the candy does not contain chocolate, and 1 is the candy
does contains chocolate.

``` r
library(ggplot2)
```

A good place to start any exploratory analysis is with a histogram…

> Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

``` r
ggplot(candy) + aes(winpercent) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5)
```

![](class10_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)

> Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

No. The graph looks slightly right skewed.

> Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

Below.

``` r
mean(candy$winpercent)
```

    [1] 50.31676

``` r
median(candy$winpercent)
```

    [1] 47.82975

> Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit
> candy?

``` r
chocolate <- candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$chocolate)]
fruit <- candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$fruity)]

mean(chocolate) > mean(fruit)
```

    [1] TRUE

Chocolate candy is higher ranked than fruit candy.

> Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

``` r
t.test(chocolate, fruit)
```


        Welch Two Sample t-test

    data:  chocolate and fruit
    t = 6.2582, df = 68.882, p-value = 2.871e-08
    alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
    95 percent confidence interval:
     11.44563 22.15795
    sample estimates:
    mean of x mean of y 
     60.92153  44.11974 

Yes it is statistically significant because the p value is below
threshold.

> Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.

``` r
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, rownames(candy)) +
  geom_col()
```

![](class10_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png)

\*Note: `geom_bar()` counts the number of occurrences by default (needs
categorical x), but `geom_col()` uses the actual values of winpercent.

> Q16. This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars
> sorted by winpercent?

``` r
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col()
```

![](class10_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png)

Let’s setup a color vector (that signifies candy type) that we can then
use for some future plots.

``` r
my_cols=rep("black", nrow(candy))
my_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] = "chocolate"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] = "brown"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] = "pink"
```

Now lets try our barplot with these colors.

``` r
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill=my_cols) 
```

![](class10_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png)

> Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

Nik L Nip

> Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

Reese Peanut Butter Cup

## 4. Taking a look at pricepercent

``` r
library(ggrepel)

# How about a plot of price vs win
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) + 
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols, size=3.3, max.overlaps = 5)
```

    Warning: ggrepel: 50 unlabeled data points (too many overlaps). Consider
    increasing max.overlaps

![](class10_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png)

> Q19. Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms of winpercent for
> the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your buck?

``` r
rownames(candy)[which.max(candy$winpercent / candy$pricepercent)]
```

    [1] "Tootsie Roll Midgies"

> Q20. What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and
> of these which is the least popular?

``` r
ord <- order(candy$pricepercent, decreasing = TRUE)
head( candy[ord,c(11,12)], n=5 )
```

                             pricepercent winpercent
    Nik L Nip                       0.976   22.44534
    Nestle Smarties                 0.976   37.88719
    Ring pop                        0.965   35.29076
    Hershey's Krackel               0.918   62.28448
    Hershey's Milk Chocolate        0.918   56.49050

Nik L Nip is the least popular.

## 5. Exploring the correlation structure

Now that we’ve explored the dataset a little, we’ll see how the
variables interact with one another. We’ll use correlation and view the
results with the corrplot package to plot a correlation matrix.

``` r
library(corrplot)
```

    corrplot 0.95 loaded

``` r
cij <- cor(candy)
corrplot(cij)
```

![](class10_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png)

> Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated
> (i.e. have minus values)?

Chocolate and fruity are the most anti-correlated.

> Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?

Chocolate and bar.

## 6. Principal Component Analysis

Let’s apply PCA using the `prcomp()` function to our candy dataset
remembering to set the `scale=TRUE` argument.

``` r
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale=TRUE)
summary(pca)
```

    Importance of components:
                              PC1    PC2    PC3     PC4    PC5     PC6     PC7
    Standard deviation     2.0788 1.1378 1.1092 1.07533 0.9518 0.81923 0.81530
    Proportion of Variance 0.3601 0.1079 0.1025 0.09636 0.0755 0.05593 0.05539
    Cumulative Proportion  0.3601 0.4680 0.5705 0.66688 0.7424 0.79830 0.85369
                               PC8     PC9    PC10    PC11    PC12
    Standard deviation     0.74530 0.67824 0.62349 0.43974 0.39760
    Proportion of Variance 0.04629 0.03833 0.03239 0.01611 0.01317
    Cumulative Proportion  0.89998 0.93832 0.97071 0.98683 1.00000

``` r
plot(pca$x[,1:2])
```

![](class10_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png)

``` r
plot(pca$x[,1:2], col=my_cols, pch=16)
```

![](class10_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-28-1.png)

We can make a much nicer plot with the ggplot2 package.

``` r
# Make a new data-frame with our PCA results and candy data
my_data <- cbind(candy, pca$x[,1:3])
```

``` r
p <- ggplot(my_data) + 
        aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, 
            size=winpercent/100,  
            text=rownames(my_data),
            label=rownames(my_data)) +
        geom_point(col=my_cols)

p
```

![](class10_files/figure-commonmark/unnamed-chunk-30-1.png)

Again we can use the ggrepel package and the function
ggrepel::geom_text_repel() to label up the plot with non overlapping
candy names like. We will also add a title and subtitle like so:

``` r
library(ggrepel)

p + geom_text_repel(size=3.3, col=my_cols, max.overlaps = 7)  + 
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title="Halloween Candy PCA Space",
       subtitle="Colored by type: chocolate bar (dark brown), chocolate other (light brown), fruity (red), other (black)",
       caption="Data from 538")
```

    Warning: ggrepel: 39 unlabeled data points (too many overlaps). Consider
    increasing max.overlaps

> Q24. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the
> positive direction? Do these make sense to you?

Values like fruity, hard, and pluribus are strongly picked up. It make
sense becasue usualy these are the cheaper options (compare to ie
chocolate and bar).
