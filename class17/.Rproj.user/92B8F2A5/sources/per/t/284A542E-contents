## Section 1: Proportion of G/G in MXL Population

Downloaded csv file from Ensembl

```{r}
mxl <- read.csv("373531-SampleGenotypes-Homo_sapiens_Variation_Sample_rs8067378.csv")
```

```{r}
round( table(mxl$Genotype..forward.strand.) / nrow(mxl) * 100, 2)
```

## Now for another population...

```{r}
gbr <- read.csv("373522-SampleGenotypes-Homo_sapiens_Variation_Sample_rs8067378.csv")
```

```{r}
round (table(gbr$Genotype..forward.strand.) / nrow(mxl) * 100, 2)
```

This variant that is associated with childhood asthma is more frequent in the GBR population than the MKL population.


## Section 4: Population Scale Analysis

One sample is obviously not enough to know what is happening in a population. You are interested in assessing genetic differences on a population scale. 

So, you processed about ~230 samples and did the normalization on a genome level. Now, you want to find whether there is any association of the 4 asthma-associated SNPs (rs8067378…) on ORMDL3 expression.

```{r}
expr <- read.table("rs8067378_ENSG00000172057.6.txt")

head(expr)
```

```{r}
nrow(expr)
```

```{r}
table(expr$geno)
```

```{r}
summary(expr)
```


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
ggplot(expr) +
  aes(geno, exp, fill=geno) +
  geom_boxplot(notch = T) +
  geom_jitter(position = position_jitter(width = 0.2), alpha = 0.3)
```
