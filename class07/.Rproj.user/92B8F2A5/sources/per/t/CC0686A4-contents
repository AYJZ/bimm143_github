Today we will explore some fundamental machine learning methods including clustering and dimensionality reduction.

## K-means clustering

To see how this works, let's first makeup some data to cluster where we know what the answer should be. We can use the `rnorm()` fuction to help here:

```{r}
hist(rnorm(500, mean=5))
```

```{r}
x <- c(rnorm(30, mean=-3), rnorm(30, mean=3))
y <- rev(x)
```

```{r}
x <- cbind(x, y)
plot(x)
```

The function for K-means clustering in "base" R is `kmeans()`

```{r}
km <- kmeans(x, centers = 2)
km
```

To get the results of the returend list object, we can use the dollor `$` syntax

> Q1. How many points are in each cluster?

```{r}
km$size
```

> Q2. What ‘component’ of your result object details - cluster assignment/membership? - cluster center?

```{r}
km$cluster
km$centers
```

> Q3. Make a clustering result figure of the data colored by cluster membership.

```{r}
plot(x, col=km$cluster, pch=16)
# if col=c("red", "blue), the vector would recycle to length of 60 alternating colors

points(km$centers, col="blue", pch=18, cex=1.5)
```

K-means clustering is very popular as it is very fast and relatively straightforward: it takes numeric data as input and returns the cluster membership vector etc.

The *"issue"* is that we tell `kmeans()` how many clusters we want.

> Q4. Run kmeans again and cluster into 4 groups and plot the results like we did above.

```{r}
km2 <- kmeans(x, centers=4)
plot(x, col=km2$cluster)
points(km2$centers, col="blue", pch=18, cex=1.5)
```

```{r}
# Within Sum of Square
mean(km$withinss)
```

*Scree plot*

```{r}
ssvec <- c()

for(i in 1:5){
  km <- kmeans(x, centers = i)
  ssvec[i] <- km$tot.withinss
}
plot(c(1:5), ssvec, type="o", xlab="Numer of clusters (k)", ylab="Total within SS", main="Scree Plot")
```


## Hierarchical Clustering

The main base R function for Hierarchical Clustering is called `hclust()`. Here we can't just input our data, we need to first calculate a distance matrix (e.g. `dist()`) for out data and use this as input to `hclust()`.

```{r}
d <- dist(x)
hc <- hclust(d)
hc
```

There is a plot method for class `hclust` results. Lets try

```{r}
plot(hc)
abline(h=8, col='red')
```

To get our cluster membership vector (i.e. out main cluster result), we can *cut the tree* at a given height or at a height that yields a given "k".

```{r}
cutree(hc, h=8)
```

```{r}
grps <- cutree(hc, k=2)
```

> Q. Plot the data with our hclust result coloring

```{r}
plot(x, col = grps, pch = 16)
```


# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## PCA of UK food data

Import food data from an online CSV file:

```{r}
url <- "https://tinyurl.com/UK-foods"
x <- read.csv(url, row.names = 1)
head(x)
```

Some base figures

```{r}
barplot(as.matrix(x), beside=T, col=rainbow(nrow(x)))
```

```{r}
# Stacked bar chart - NOT useful
barplot(as.matrix(x), beside=F, col=rainbow(nrow(x)))
```

There is one plot that can be useful for small datasets:

```{r}
pairs(x, col=rainbow(nrow(x)), pch=16)
```

> Main point: It can be difficult to spot major trends and patterns even in relatively small multivariate datasets (here we only have 17 dimensions. Typically we have 1000s).


## PCA to the rescue

The main function in "base" R for PCA is called `prcomp()`.

I will take the transpose of our data so the "foods" are in columns.

```{r}
pca <- prcomp( t(x) ) 
summary(pca)

# See how PC1 and PC2 captured 96% of the variance -> good enough representative of the data
```

```{r}
cols <- c("orange","red","blue","green")
plot(pca$x[,1], pca$x[,2], col=cols, pch=16)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
ggplot(pca$x) +
  aes(PC1, PC2) +
  geom_point(col = cols) +
  theme_classic()
```

```{r}
ggplot(pca$rotation) +
  aes(PC1, rownames(pca$rotation)) +
  geom_col()

# How much each variable weighs in the PCA
```

PCA looks really useful and we will come back to discuss this further next class (Class 8).
