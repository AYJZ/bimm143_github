## AlphaFold Database (AFDB)

The EBI maintains the largest dataase of AlphaFold structure prediction models at: https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/ 

From last class (class 9), we saw that the PDB has 244,290 (Oct 2025) protein **structures**. 

The total number of protein **sequences** in UniProtKB is 199,579,901.

> Key Point: this is a tiny fraction of sequence space that has structural converage (0.12%).

```{r}
244290 / 199579901 * 100
```

AFDB is attempting to address this gap...

There are two "Quality Scores" from AlphaFold, one for residues (i.e. each amino acids) called **pLDDT** score. The other is Predicted Aligned Error (**PAE**), which measures the confidence in the relative position of two residues (i.e. a score for every pair of residues).


## Generating your own structure predictions

# Custom analysis of resulting models in R

Read key result files into R. The first thing I need to know is what my results directory/folder is called (i.e. its name differ from every AlphaFold run/job)

```{r}
results_dir <- "HIVPrDimer_23119/"
```

```{r}
# File names for all PDB models
pdb_files <- list.files(path=results_dir,
                        pattern="*.pdb",
                        full.names = TRUE)

# Print our PDB file names
basename(pdb_files)
```

```{r}
library(bio3d)

# Read all data from Models 
#  and superpose/fit coords
pdbs <- pdbaln(pdb_files, fit=TRUE, exefile="msa")
```

```{r}
pdbs
```

```{r}
rd <- rmsd(pdbs, fit=T)
range(rd)
```

```{r}
library(pheatmap)

colnames(rd) <- paste0("m",1:5)
rownames(rd) <- paste0("m",1:5)
pheatmap(rd)
```
Here we can see that models 1 and 2 are more similar to each other than they are to any other model. Models 4 and 5 are quite similar to each other and in turn more similar to model 3 than to models 1 and 2.

Plotting pLDDT values

```{r}
# Read a reference PDB structure
pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
```

```{r}
plotb3(pdbs$b[1,], typ="l", lwd=2, sse=pdb)
points(pdbs$b[2,], typ="l", col="red")
points(pdbs$b[3,], typ="l", col="blue")
points(pdbs$b[4,], typ="l", col="darkgreen")
points(pdbs$b[5,], typ="l", col="orange")
abline(v=100, col="gray")
```

```{r}
core <- core.find(pdbs)
```

We can now use the identified core atom positions as a basis for a more suitable superposition and write out the fitted structures to a directory called corefit_structures:

```{r}
core.inds <- print(core, vol=0.5)
```

```{r}
xyz <- pdbfit(pdbs, core.inds, outpath="corefit_structures")
```

![](corefit.png)

Now we can examine the RMSF between positions of the structure.

```{r}
rf <- rmsf(xyz)

plotb3(rf, sse=pdb)
abline(v=100, col="gray", ylab="RMSF")
```

## Predicted Alignment Error for domains

Independent of the 3D structure, AlphaFold produces an output called Predicted Aligned Error (PAE).

```{r}
library(jsonlite)

# Listing of all PAE JSON files
pae_files <- list.files(path=results_dir,
                        pattern=".*model.*\\.json",
                        full.names = TRUE)
```

Lets read 1 and 5 for example.

```{r}
pae1 <- read_json(pae_files[1],simplifyVector = TRUE)
pae5 <- read_json(pae_files[5],simplifyVector = TRUE)

attributes(pae1)
```

```{r}
# Per-residue pLDDT scores 
#  same as B-factor of PDB..
head(pae1$plddt) 
```

We can plot the N by N (where N is the number of residues) PAE scores with ggplot or with functions from the Bio3D package:

```{r}
plot.dmat(pae1$pae, 
          xlab="Residue Position (i)",
          ylab="Residue Position (j)")
```

```{r}
plot.dmat(pae5$pae, 
          xlab="Residue Position (i)",
          ylab="Residue Position (j)",
          grid.col = "black",
          zlim=c(0,30))
```

We should really plot all of these using the same z range. Here is the model 1 plot again but this time using the same data range as the plot for model 5:

```{r}
plot.dmat(pae1$pae, 
          xlab="Residue Position (i)",
          ylab="Residue Position (j)",
          grid.col = "black",
          zlim=c(0,30))
```


## Residue conservation from alignment file

Find the large AlphaFold alignment file

```{r}
aln_file <- list.files(path=results_dir,
                       pattern=".a3m$",
                        full.names = TRUE)
aln_file
```

Read this into R

```{r}
aln <- read.fasta(aln_file[1], to.upper = TRUE)
```

How many sequences are in this alignment

```{r}
dim(aln$ali)
```

We can score residue conservation in the alignment with the conserv() function.

```{r}
sim <- conserv(aln)
```

```{r}
plotb3(sim[1:99], ylab="Conservation Score")
```

We can look at what the concensus sequences are (the heart of this molecule).

```{r}
con <- consensus(aln, cutoff = 0.9)
con$seq
```

We can map this conservation score to the Occupancy column of a PDB file for viewing in molecular viewer programs such as Mol*.

```{r}
m1.pdb <- read.pdb(pdb_files[1])
occ <- vec2resno(c(sim[1:99], sim[1:99]), m1.pdb$atom$resno)
write.pdb(m1.pdb, o=occ, file="m1_conserv.pdb")
```

Here is an image of this data generated from and Mol* using coloring by Occupancy.

Note that we can now clearly see the central conserved active site in this model where the natural peptide substrate (and small molecule inhibitors) would bind between domains.
